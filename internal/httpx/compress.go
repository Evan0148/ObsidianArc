// Compress gzips a response when the client said it could take one.

// It is worth more than anything else this server does to what goes on the
// wire. The frontend is about 200 kB of JavaScript and CSS uncompressed and
// roughly a quarter of that compressed, and the deployment this project
// documents has nothing in front of it — no proxy, no CDN — so if the origin
// does not compress, nothing does.
//
// The decision is an allowlist rather than a denylist, because the one thing
// that must never be compressed is also the one that would fail silently. A
// streamed answer pushed through a compressor arrives when the compressor's
// buffer fills rather than when the model produced a word: the chat would sit
// still and then drop a paragraph, with nothing in any log to say why. So
// text/event-stream is not on the list, and neither is a response whose type
// the handler never stated — which is a belt-and-braces case now that the SSE
// helper names its type before committing anything, and was load-bearing when
// it did not.
