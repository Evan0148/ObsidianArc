// Device identity: recognising a browser across sign-ins, separately from any
// one session.
//
// A session already carries an IP and a user agent, but it is exactly as
// long-lived as its TTL, and a fresh one is issued on every sign-in — neither
// is "a device". The cookie here is deliberately a second one, long-lived and
// unrelated to the session cookie's lifetime, so that a device is still
// recognised after the session that first saw it has expired or been signed
// out. Like the session token, only its digest is stored: a database dump
// hands out no working cookies.

// deviceCookieDays is roughly a year and a bit — long enough that an
// account's own laptop is never treated as new again after a routine gap,
// short enough that a cookie nobody has presented in well over a year does
// not go on describing a device forever.
